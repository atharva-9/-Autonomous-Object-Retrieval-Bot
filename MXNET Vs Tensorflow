Advantages of Tensorflow:
User Friendly. Easy to learn if you are familiar with Python.
Tensorboard for monitoring and visualization. It is a great tool if you want to see your deep learning models in action.
Community support. Experts engineers from Google and other companies improve TensorFlow almost on a daily basis.
You can use TensorFlow Lite to run TensorFlow models on mobile devices.
Tensorflow.js lets you to run real-time deep learning models in the browser using JavaScript.

Limitations of Tensorflow:
TensorFlow is a bit slow compared to frameworks like MxNet and CNTK.
Debugging can be challenging.
No support for OpenCL.

Advantages of Apache MXNet:
Efficient, scalable, and fast.
Supported by all major platforms.
Provides GPU support, along with multi-GPU mode.
Support for programming languages like Scala, R, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
Easy model serving and high-performance API.

Disadvantages of Apache MXNet:
Compared to TensorFlow, MXNet has a smaller open source community.
Improvements, bug fixes, and other features take longer due to a lack of major community support.
Despite being widely used by many organizations in the tech industry, MxNet is not as popular as Tensorflow.
